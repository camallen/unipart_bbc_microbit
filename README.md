### Unipart BBC Micro:bit workshop

Use a BBC Micro:bit to learn how to code and use electronics!

#### Workshop Activities
First we'll need to connect up our Micro:bit to the computer using the usb cable, it's easy do it just like a phone or a camera! Once your Mirco:bit is connected we can make code run on it, but first we need code!

We'll be coding up our BBC Micro:bits using the Blocks editor today, visit https://www.microbit.co.uk/app and click create code, then select the "Block Editor".

We'll be working through these activities in the workshop. Number 1 is the easiest and will get you started with connecting and coding the Micro:bit. Number 2 is a stretch goal if you have time.
